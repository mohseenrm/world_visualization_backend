<p style="font-size:160%;"> The goal of this project is to visualize the Financial and Economical progress of nations and its population over the course of time since the post World War II period. The impact of changes and major events in the financial realm of one nation and how it affected other nations over this period can be observed.
    We have obtained the dataset from World Development Indicators, which is the primary World Bank collection of development indicators, compiled from officially-recognised sources. The global development data pertaining to various areas available here is accurate that enlightens analysts on topics of immediate and perennial interest in business, economics, investing, lifestyle, personal finance and politics & policy.

    Through the series of visualizations as illustrated in the PowerPoint presentation,  we intend to convey a story using a composite index that gives an overall perspective of a nation’s wealth. The stories of the unexpected Brexit and the increasing influence of politics in finance (post-2009) might captivate the intended audience.
    The datasets and related visualizations provide insights on Employment rates, Wealth Inequality, Population Growth, Financial Stability Index, and International Immigration rates etc. These insights are particularly in the interests of diverse set of audience. The analysis of global population trends favor the real estate investors in making their decisions related to future land acquisitions. The Department of Homeland Security would refer to the insights related to the pattern of Immigration in their respective countries. The Financial Stability index can be used Venture Capitalists; and Economists and Government officials can utilize the Wealth Inequality insights for their analysis. This project will also enable viewers to trace and track the trends in different nations in this period. We plan to visualize the growth of every country according to the chosen dataset.We intend to define a correlation between several aspects of an economy and how these aspects influenced the overall index of the economy. Examples could be ranging from political unrest, public satisfaction and health index, etc.



    The analysis and visualization of this dataset will be interesting to a wide range of people ranging from an ordinary person, economists to global leaders in order to get an estimate of world’s growth in terms of expenditure, investments, and development.</p>
